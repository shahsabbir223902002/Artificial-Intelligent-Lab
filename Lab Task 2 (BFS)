Task 2:
1. Write a program to perform BFS traversal on a 2D plane by taking the user input of grid size N. After
that generate N×N matrix and place the obstacles randomly. Now print the matrix and take user input
of starting and goal state.
2. Print the required moves throughout the traversal along with the tiles coordinate.
For example -
Moving Down -> (2, 3)
Moving Right -> (2, 4)
...
etc.
